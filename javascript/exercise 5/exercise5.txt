// Make a keyless car EVEN BETTER!
// We are improving our car from previous exercise now.
// Solutions to future exercises will be in the .js file (meaning Javascript file) from now on.

var age = prompt("What is your age?");

//1. Make the above code have a function called checkDriverAge(). Whenever you call this function, you will get prompted for age. Use Function Declaration to create this function.
// Notice the benefit in having checkDriverAge() instead of copying and pasting the function everytime?
function checkDriverAge(a) {
	var a = prompt("What's your age?");
	a = Number(a);
	if (a < 18) alert("Sorry, you are too young to drive this car. Powering off")
		else if (a > 18) alert("Powering On. Enjoy the ride!")
			else if (a === 18) alert("Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!");
}
checkDriverAge()

//2. Create another function that does the same thing, called checkDriverAge2() using Function Expression.

var checkDriverAge2 = function(a) {
	var a = prompt("What's your age?");
	a = Number(a);
	if (a < 18) alert("Sorry, you are too young to drive this car. Powering off")
		else if (a > 18) alert("Powering On. Enjoy the ride!")
			else if (a === 18) alert("Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!");
}

checkDriverAge2()

//BONUS: Instead of using the prompt. Now, only use the return keyword and make the checkDriverAge() function accept an argument of age, so that if you enter:
checkDriverAge(92);
it returns "Powering On. Enjoy the ride!"

checkDriverAge(age) {
	return age;
